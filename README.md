# 1-fiber-SPACE
Bayesian estimation of fiber direction using Spatial Prior involving neighborhood information

We applied Bayesian methodology and MCMC technique to estimate the fiber Direction within corpus callosum using DT-MRI signals. We developed a methodology to resolve fiber 
crossing problem by collecting neighbourhood information, processing them for each voxel and using them as prior to have a coherent model.

For 1-fiber-SPACE, the R codes are provided.
